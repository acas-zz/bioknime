        Accesses the InterProScan web service (provided by EBI) with the user-specified settings. This node
        selects the chosen (protein) sequence column and sends each sequence to EBI for analysis.

        selects the chosen (protein) sequence column and sends each sequence to EBI for analysis. The results
        are appended to the input columns. The input RowID is used as the title for each job with EBI (for manual
