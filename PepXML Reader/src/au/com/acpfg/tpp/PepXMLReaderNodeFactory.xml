    <shortDescription>
        Reads PepXML (as produced by the trans-proteomics pipeline) to enable processing of peptide/protein identifications and statistics using KNIME

        <intro>This node provides most of the key data from <a href="http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Formats:pepXML">PepXML</a> documents, as produced by the
        <a href="http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:TPP">Trans-Proteomic Pipeline</a>. This gives KNIME the ability to process spectral assignments to peptides
        and/or proteins and therefore to analyse the available data. This node is often used
        in conjunction with Mascot .DAT Reader and other TPP nodes to perform a broad analysis of results
        in a Proteomics experiment.
