    <shortDescription>
        Accesses the UniProt data source (via webservices) which is maintained by a consortium including the
        European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI).

        <intro> Provides access to the <a href="http://www.uniprot.org">UniProtKB data source</a> which is maintained by a consortium including the
        European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). This node provides most of the data supported by UniProt,
        UniRef and UniPARC in a tabular format, ready for processing by other KNIME nodes. This node is 
        deliberately slow to avoid overloading the remote web servers which provide the data.
        
        A later edition of this node will provide for custom uniprot queries.

        <option name="Task">Select what you want the node to do:
        <ol>
        	<li>Access UniProt: provide the accessions which you want UniProt data for</li>
        	<li>Access UniRef: you must specify the required level of clustering identity amongst cluster
        	members (50%, 90% and 100% requirement)</li>
        	<li>Access UniPARC: specify the UPI number or full-length sequence which you require data for</li>
        </ol>
        </option>
        
        <option name="Accession">Which column contains the UniProtKB accessions eg. <tt>QA55DA</tt>, the
        node will not report anything if the column does not contain suitable data. You'll need to manually
        check which accessions gave you hits.</option>
