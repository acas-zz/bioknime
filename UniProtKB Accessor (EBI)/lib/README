UniParc or UniRef entry with a given accession number, or the whole entry sets
matching a query.

UniProt Java API use Spring framework (http://www.springframework.org) "httpinvoker" module
for a remote data access.Spring's HTTP invoker provides a special remoting strategy which
allows for Java serialization via HTTP, supporting any Java interface.

2. DISTRIBUTION

./src - Source files for examples on using the UniProtJAPI
./classes - The pre-compiled sources
./lib - Library's required to run the UniProtJAPI including the UniProtJAPI
./doc - Documenation and JavaDoc of Object model.


3. RUN THE EXAMPLES

use the runExample script provided .cmd for windows for .sh most other enviroments. The script requires a single
parameter which is the name of the test to be run. The test's can be found in the /src directory. 

e.g. on windows

runExample.cmd AttributeExample

on unix

sh runExample.sh AttributeExample

This command will run then the AttributeExample class located in the /classes directory
