    <fullDescription>
        <intro>The <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/picr/">PICR</a> web service provides mapping from sequence and/or accession to the
        specified set of databases. It is useful for many problems where you must work with
        multiple database entries. Maps do contain errors, however, so be careful during your analysis.
        The UniProt node provides similar functionality as well, so you may wish to compare.
        <p>
        Results are in one of two forms:
        <ol>
        	<li><em>Logical</em>: a relationship between two sequences as designated by a curator</li>
        	<li><em>Identical</em>: a relationship based on the identity of the two sequences</li>
        </ol>
        This node clearly marks each result. PICR supports over eighty databases, however, you can
        choose to only provide entries in a particular database (if they exist!). Furthermore, you can
        restrict map entries to a particular NCBI taxon ID or just those map entries which are still
        active.

        <option name="Accessions">Select the column to use for accessions to give to PICR. These must
        be in a compatible format. It is also possible to choose a (protein) sequence column, although
        these should be full length sequences for best results.</option>
        
        <option name="Databases to map to">Select the (multiple) databases which you want the accession/sequence mapped to</option>
    
    	<option name="NCBI taxonomy ID">To restrict map entries to a particular species in a valid
    	NCBI taxonomy ID or choose one from the list of available (popular) species.</option>
    	
    	<option name="Active only?">To remove inactive entries from results, select this option.</option>
