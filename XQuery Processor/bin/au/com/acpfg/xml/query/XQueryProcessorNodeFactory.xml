    <name>XQuery Processor</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Provides an XQuery knime api &amp; XML "blob" cell type and data processing. Useful for many life science XML formats (PepXML, ProtXML, etc. etc.)
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node applies multiple XQuery statements to the chosen XML column, returning the 
        results for these queries to the user. This can be used to get data from XML documents conforming to many standards
        currently in widespread use. XQEngine is used as a backend to perform the queries. It is also
        possible to save and open files with queries in them, to facilitate sharing of queries.
        
        <p>The amount of memory consuming by this node depends on the amount of XML in each cell. As a 
        general rule you need approximately 100MB memory for each 25MB of XML, but this varies depending
        on the XML. Compressed files are not currently supported. This implementation uses
        <a href="http://xqengine.sourceforge.net">XQEngine</a> to execute the queries, so it has
        the same limitations.</p>
        </intro>
        
        
        <option name="Data Source">If the input table contains multiple XML columns, this tab lets
        the user choose what input column is processed. Missing values will be ignored.</option>
        <option name="Selected Directory">If <em>load all files in folder</em> is checked, this option
        lets you specify a folder full of XML files. Each query will be applied in turn to each file,
        before proceeding to the next file. It is up to the user to ensure the folder only contains
        well formed XML documents, or an error will generally result</option>
        
        <option name="XQueries">
        Displays a list of XQuery-compatible entries, each of which will be run over each XML input file.
        Results depend on the query and on the chosen output format, which appears on the bottom left. You may
        also change the name for each query which determines the output column name. Queries may be disabled
        which maximises performance when a query is not needed. A set of queries can be loaded/saved to a file
        or even added to the existing queries as needed.

        </option>
        
        <option name="Edit Query">
        The currently selected XQuery is displayed in this panel: it permits the user to change the query,
        its results (in terms of KNIME columns) and the name of the output columns. Changes made here are
        automatically reflected in the list of XQueries.
