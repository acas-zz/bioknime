    <name>Peak Extractor</name>
    
    <shortDescription>
        Extracts data defining a peak from any cell supporting SpectralDataInterface (defined in the SpectraReader node)

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node extracts data from spectra previously loaded (eg. using the Spectra Reader node)
        and stores it in the output table. The idea is to be able to identify spectra within large
        scale experiments or to aid in publication of the data. This node will work with any type of
        Spectra, however it does not take into account the units, the user will need to be careful here
        if the sources of spectra have different units specified.</intro>
        
        
        <option name="Spectra Column">Choose the column containing the spectra you wish to extract peak data from</option>
        <option name="Peak list">Define the list of peaks to extract: you can give each peak a name, m/z of
        the middle of the region of interest and a left tolerance and right tolerance. The extracted interval
        is defined from [mz-left,mz+right) for each peak. Be sure to get the desired tolerance right, it is easy to forget!</option>
