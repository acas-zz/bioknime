This node uses the following two java packages to provide functionality for
itself and for other nodes within this package:

1) EBI MUSCLE AXIS SOAP client:
   http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/services/msa/muscle_soap
   

2) PAL Phylogenetic Library
   http://www.cebl.auckland.ac.nz/pal-project/index.html
   PAL is distributed under the LGPL license, see the LICENSE.pal in the root
