    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Provides multiple alignment of sequences via <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/MUSCLE/">MUSCLE</a> as implemented by EBI. This node
        is deliberately polite to EBI servers to avoid being banned from EBI's excellent servers - please be patient!
        
        <p>This node works by processing two collection columns: each column, for a given row, must have the same number of elements in it eg. 5 accessions means 5 sequences.
        Each row comprises a separate MUSCLE job for EBI and it will align only the sequences in the current row being processed.</p>
        
        <p>This node produces two outputs: one is Base64 encoded, so that it can be passed safely into the R KNIME nodes for processing by phanghorn/ape packages (or others as described
        by <a href="http://www.cran.r-project.org/web/views/Phylogenetics.html">R Phylogenetics packages</a>).
        The other, is designed with the view for this node. Note that memory requirements increase with the
        number of alignments, so more than 100 rows to align is not recommended (as a rule of thumb).
        </p>
        
        <p><b>NOTE</b>: this node does not permit more than one thousand sequences in a single MUSCLE job, the real practical limit is likely to be much lower. In practical
        terms, more than 50 sequences for a single tree is likely to be unreadable.</p>

        <option name="Email Address">Should EBI have a problem with your jobs, they may contact you using this email address. <b>WARNING:</b> not providing a valid
        email address may get you banned from EBI (your IP or perhaps your entire organisation's network)</option>
        
        <option name="Sequence Collection">A collection column (see the Create Collection Column node) which contains the set of sequences to align for each
        MUSCLE job. Each row is a separate MUSCLE job.</option>
        
        <option name="Accession Collection">A collection column which contains the set of accessions (in the same order as the sequences above) to use for naming
        the aligned sequences. Every sequence must have a corresponding accession. The accession must satisfy limitations imposed by MUSCLE or the jobs may not work.</option>
