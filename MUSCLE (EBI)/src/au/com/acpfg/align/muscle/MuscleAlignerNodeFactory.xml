    <shortDescription>
        Using EBI web services, this node performs a multi-alignment. WARNING: your property is exposed to an external provider, be sure your intellectual property is preserved!

        <intro>This nodes performs alignments of sequences using <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk">EBI</a> 
        MUSCLE web service 
        (up to 1000 sets of sequences is currently supported, although
        it is recommended that these be less than 500 residues). The node expects two collections per row
        with the following attributes:
        <ol>
        	<li>A list of sequences (eg. as created by the <b>GroupBy</b> node)</li>
        	<li>A list of accessions in the same order as the sequences (and same length)</li>
        </ol>
        The user must also specify the type of sequence (nucleotide or protein) and an email
        address by which EBI can contact you if there is a problem. 
        <p>
        This node is deliberately slow to ensure it meets the EBI terms of service and users must be
        aware that their sequence data is exposed to the public Internet by use of this node.</p>
