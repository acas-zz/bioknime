This KNIME node requires GLPK "GNU Linear Programming Kit" to compute the
minimum set cover ILP formulation. GLPK v4.4 must be installed 
on the computer where KNIME is installed for the node to operate.

Further details can be found at http://www.gnu.org/s/glpk/

The author gratefully acknowledges this product, whose excellent work
makes the node straightforward.
