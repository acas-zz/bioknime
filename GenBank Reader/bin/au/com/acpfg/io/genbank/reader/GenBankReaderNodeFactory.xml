    <shortDescription>
        This node is a quick-and-dirty implementation of the Genbank file format, designed for
        extraction of data (eg. for a particular species) from a genbank mirror. As such it should
        be considered for serious use with care.
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro> This node reads the specified
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genbank">Genbank format</a> files/folder for compressed and/or uncompressed files 
        and loads the key metadata (including features) into one of three output ports. Coding sequence data is
        placed into the "CDS data", source material metadata is placed into the "Source Features" table, and
        sequence related data is placed into the first output port. 
        
        <p><b>WARNING:</b>this node does not comply with all aspects for the file format. The intention is
        to be fast, rather than standards compliant. Most major portions of the sequence data are available.</p>

        <option name="load single file?">If checked, a single file is loaded, otherwise a folder in which all suitable files are read.</option>
        <option name="Filename">A compressed (gzip only) or uncompressed file may be chosen</option>
        <option name="Folder">A folder which contains the genbank files (compressed or not). Subfolders are not searched</option>
        <option name="Data to load">Currently ignored. Most data is already loaded into the table.</option>
        <option name="Filter by taxonomy"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/">Enter keywords</a> (only one is required to match) to accept a given entry. This
        can be either a lineage term or a keyword from a scientific name</option>
        <option name="Filter by filename">Genbank standardises filenames, if you are only interested in a subset of filenames eg. EST sequences only from genbank you might specify
        a filename keyword of <tt>gbest</tt>. Only one keyword is required to match to accept the file.</option>
        <option name="Source Features">If selected, causes the node to place source metadata for each accession at the second output port</option>
        <option name="CDS Features">If selected, causes the node to place CDS metadata for each accession at the third output port. Not all
        species have this information available so don't be surprised if no output is produced even if selected.</option>
