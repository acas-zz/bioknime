        This node implements the algorithm described in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v24/n10/abs/nbt1240.html">A probability-based approach for high-throughput
        protein phosphorylation analysis and site localization</a> by Steven P. Gygi et al.

        <intro>This node implements the algorithm described in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v24/n10/abs/nbt1240.html">A probability-based approach for high-throughput
        protein phosphorylation analysis and site localization</a> by Steven P. Gygi et al.
        <p>
        The node expects identified spectra from the Mascot Reader along with the matched &amp; theoretical ions
        for each spectra. You may also impose limits on which amino acid residues are considered by the
        algorithm for analysis.

        <option name="Spectra Column">Choose the column which the Mascot identified spectra have been loaded into. This must provide
        the correct spectra for the data in the other configure options or results will be wrong.</option>
        
        <option name="Matched ions (B&amp;Y series only)">Select the list of b&amp;y ions column as provided by the Mascot Reader node</option>
        
        <option name="Peptide Sequence (including modifications)">Select the modified peptide sequence (including estimations by
        mascot of where the phosphorylation is in the sequence) as provided by the Mascot Reader node. The correct column to choose is normally
        named <tt>Modified peptide sequence</tt></option>
        
        <option name="Residues to consider for phosphorylation">In a given experiment, not all residues may be permitted to phosphorylate - select
        those amino acids to be considered as potential sites by the algorithm. All other residues will be ignored. To be evaluated
        by the algorithm a peptide must contain <em>at least two</em> sites in its peptide sequence. Other peptides will not be reported.
